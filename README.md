# Forest-Fire-Exit-Path-Guidance

###  Intelligent AI-based Evacuation Route Simulation using Pathfinding Algorithms  

---

## Overview  
The **Forest Fire Exit Path Guidance System** is an intelligent, real-time simulation designed to model fire spread and guide individuals to the safest evacuation route during a forest fire.  
The system uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and multiple **pathfinding algorithms** to dynamically calculate optimal escape routes by considering fire intensity, smoke density, and wind direction.  

Developed using **Python (Pygame)**, this project demonstrates how AI can be used to enhance **disaster management and evacuation planning**.

##  Objectives  
- Simulate a forest environment with dynamically spreading fire and smoke.  
- Implement multiple pathfinding algorithms to calculate safe escape routes.  
- Evaluate algorithms based on **safety, cost, and execution time**.  
- Enable **real-time rerouting** when existing paths become unsafe.  
- Provide an interactive and visual simulation for analysis and learning.
